# Smart Home Automation

## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository of our Smart Home Automation Project! This project is designed to automate 2 processes. 
1. Smart Irrigation Process for personal gardening purposes
2. Smart Fan Automation for home comfort

## 1. Smart Irrigation
### Features
- **Automated Watering**: Automatically waters your plant based on the soil moisture level.
<!-- - **Easy Configuration**: A user-friendly interface to set up and manage watering schedules. -->
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Monitor soil moisture and weather updates in real-time via our mobile app or web dashboard.
<!-- - **Energy Efficient**: Designed to save water and reduce energy consumption by using advanced algorithms to determine the precise amount of water needed. -->

### Hardware Requirements
- Soil moisture sensor
- Microcontroller (ESP32C6)
- Water pump
- Tubing and irrigation supplies
- Power supply

### Software Requirements
- ESP-IDF for programming the microcontroller
- Rainmaker Application

### Installation
- Assemble the hardware components as per the schematic diagram available in the `schematics` folder.
TBC


### Configuration
- **Moisture Threshold**: Set the desired soil moisture level that triggers the irrigation system.
<!-- - **Watering Schedule**: Customize the watering intervals and duration according to your specific needs. -->

### Usage
After installation and configuration, the system will automatically start monitoring the soil moisture and begin irrigation when necessary. You can monitor the system's status and make any adjustments through the rainmaker app.
